# Todo
This is a to-do list application to keep track of tasks, offering weekly and daily views.

To run, clone the repository, open in android studio, and run.

# Features
To add a new task, press the green plus in the bottom right corner. 

Todo allows you to record the task, set a priority level (low, medium, high), and set a target completion date.

To view all tasks, select the All Items tab. You can mark the tasks as complete using a checkbox.

To view tasks for a week (or several days), go to the Weekly View tab and select a date range. This will show you all tasks that have a target completion date in that range.

To view tasks for a single day, select the Daily View tab and select a date. This will show all tasks that have a target completion date on the selected date.
